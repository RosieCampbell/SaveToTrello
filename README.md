# SaveToTrello
Chrome Extension to save webpages to Trello.

## Description
Click the Trello icon in your Chrome browser to save your current web page as a card to one of your starred boards. 

Cards are added to the top of the first list in that board, and can be organised further at a later date. 

The extension will save the title, description and URL of the page, as well as a header image if available.

##To Install
1. Download all the files into a folder on your computer.
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) and make sure you have ticked 'enable developer mode'.
3. Click 'Load unpacked extension...'.
4. Navigate to the folder and select it.

(You will need to refresh any open webpages before the extension will work on them)

Disclaimer: This is my first Chrome extension, it might be a bit buggy, and I'll be working to improve the code and address any accessibility issues. If you encounter a problem, let me know :)
